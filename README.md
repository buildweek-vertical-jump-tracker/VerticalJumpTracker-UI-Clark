# VerticalJumpTracker-UI-Clark
    My Vertical Jump tracker marketing page has 3 different html pages. The landing page has all the information about the app and why you should use it, with a javascript quote component, pictures, buttons to sign up and log in to the app, and links to the other two pages, the About Us page and the Contact page. The Contact page has an email form to send an email to the company, with a phone number and address at the bottom. The About Us page has pictures of all the team members with their names and roles, with a brief description about us.

    I styled the all of the pages mobile-first, and they are all fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop. I made use of flexbox a lot, and added lots of styling details such as pseudoclasses, animations, shadows, gradients, and more.
    
    I built a quote component that cycles through quotes every 20 seconds with a new quote.

    The technology I used is native HTML and JavaScript with a LESS CSS preprocessor.
